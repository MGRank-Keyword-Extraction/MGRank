# MGRank: A keyword extraction system based on multigraph GoW model and novel edge weighting procedure

MGRank is a keyword extraction method that uses a complete multigraph structure to build a GoW model to represent a text. The proposed GoW model provides the ability to represent a document globally and eliminates the need to specify the window size parameter. Parallel edges allow multiple relationships to be established between keyword candidates. MGRank also proposes a new edge weighting method based on the positional distance of candidate keywords.

The code is suitable for use Colab. If the code is run in colab, there is no need to install any libraries.
